# BUNEMAN INSTABILITY
Use the following parameters: $\texttt{L}=2\pi$, $\texttt{Nt} = 5000$, $\texttt{dt}= 0.1$, $\texttt{Ng} =512$, $\texttt{N1}=10000$, $\texttt{N2}=10000$, $\texttt{Ni}=0$,
$\texttt{V01}=1$, $\texttt{V02}=0$, $\texttt{Vth1}=0.004$, $\texttt{Vth2}=0$, $\texttt{QM1}=-1$, $\texttt{QM2}=0.001$, $\texttt{XP1}=0$, $\texttt{XP2}=0$, $\texttt{M1}=0$ and $\texttt{M2}=0$.

Watch how the system evolves. You should be able to see the formation of electron holes in phase space and bipolar electric field pulses:
