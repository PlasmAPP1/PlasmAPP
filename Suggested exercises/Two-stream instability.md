# ELECTRON-ELECTRON TWO-STREAM INSTABILITY

To simulate the phenomenon the following parameters use: $\texttt{L}=64$, $\texttt{Nt} = 16000$ $\texttt{dt}= 0.1$, $\texttt{Ng} = 256$, $\texttt{N1}=10000$, $\texttt{N2}=10000$, $\texttt{Ni}=20000$,
$\texttt{V01}=5$, $\texttt{V02}=-5$, $\texttt{Vth1}=1$, $\texttt{Vth2}=1$, $\texttt{QM1}=-1$, $\texttt{QM2}=-1$, and $\texttt{WP1}=1$. 

Plot the phase space, the electric potential, and the electric field, and see how the system evolves. You shoud be able to see the formation of electron phase-space holes.
